    "The final topic we are going to cover in this lab is how to identify and remove duplicate rows (or rows that refer to the same entity) in our data. When trying to identify duplicates, we will use the columns (or attributes) of the data to help us determine what entities are similar enough to be considered the same entity. We want to start with all the columns we currently have available to us and work our way toward a lesser number of attributes in an intuitive fashion. In this process, the act of dropping duplicated records is easy, but identifying the correct attributes for comparison and which records to drop is sometimes quite challenging.\n",
